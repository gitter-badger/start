Welcome home, ethereum builder!
=====
This is a community for like-minded individuals, passionate about ethereum and the possibilities it opens. This is a community for people like you, that like to create and experiment. You are welcome to experiment here, so throw your craziest of ideas on the boards __after__ following the quick start guide bellow!

### Step one. Supercharge GitHub.

Here's how you can transform your usual GitHub account into a powerful project management tool in two steps.

**1.** Go to https://www.zenhub.io/ or directly install the Chrome extension from [the webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd)

**2.** Connect your GitHub account with Zenhub. 
* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ZenHub as one of the authorized applications.

Please read these two articles if you want to understand more about how this works:
* [Getting started with ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/getting-started-with-zenhub/)
* [Supercharge GitHub Workflows](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/supercharge-github-workflows-introducing-zenhub-part-i/)

*Please note that you __need__ to install the zenhub extension in order to view and use GitHub as described in this guide. 

### Step two. Tokenize GitHub comments.

A token of appreciation goes a long way! Mention the lucky @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send.

Here's how to get you started:

**1.** Connect your GitHub account with [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/github)

* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ChangeTip as one of the authorized applications.

**2.** Reward programmers for their effort by simply mentioning their @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send. For example "@changetip send 0.01 BTC to @username".

**3.** Enjoy the warm, fuzzy feeling for contributing to something that matters to you.


That's it, you're set. Let's get to the next step.

### Step three. Support the initiatives and applications you'd like to see built!

* Go to [the ideas board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/ideas#boards "ethereum.builders/ideas") for concepts in idea stages
* Go to [the proposal board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals#boards "ethereum.builders/proposals") for concepts in proposal stages
* Go to [our projects board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/projects#boards "ethereum.builders/projects") for concepts in development stages


### Accelerate the creation of **quality** content and documentation

Either via tips or bounties you can incentivize the creation of the content (blogpost, screencast, tutorial) or documentation for the applications and topics that excite you! You're now a co-creator of a new _Internet_, through GitHub, a browser extension and Bitcoin. How cool is that? 

### Bounties for the things you want to see done! 

Bounties are an excellent way to get things done. Make sure to follow the format bellow for easy visibility. 

Here's an [article](http://blog.bountysource.com/post/89776164469/waffle-bountysource-attracting-open-source-community ) showing how an integration between a different (but similar) product and github works for bounties. Will make our own example soon.

### How to create bounties

**1.** Go to one of the boards, or create a new one. 

**2.** Create an issue with the **label** __bounty__  

**3.** The bounty __[amount]__ must be added at the end of the issue name

**4.** The description of the task should list the requirements as clear as possible in order to avoid confusion. Think it through before posting it. 

- [x] Create checklists by typing "- [ ]" at the begining of your sentences. You can mark them as done by inserting an X (i.e. - [X]) in order to track the progress in an easy way. 

More info on tasklists can be found [here](https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)

### How to pay the bounties?

Easy! At delivery, mention the @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send. For example "@changetip send 0.01 BTC to @username".
