Either via tips or bounties you can incentivize the creation of the content (blogpost, screencast, tutorial) or documentation for the applications and topics that excite you! You're now a co-creator of a new _Internet_, through GitHub a browser extension and Bitcoin. How cool is that? 

### Bounties for the things you want to see done! 

Bounties are an excellent way to get things done. Make sure to follow the format bellow for easy visibility. 

Here's an article showing how an integration between a different (but similar) product and github works for bounties: http://blog.bountysource.com/post/89776164469/waffle-bountysource-attracting-open-source-community . Will make our own example soon.

- [ ] Create an issue with the label _bounty_  
- [ ] The bounty _[amount]_ must be added at the end of the bounty issue name
- [ ] The description of the task should list the requirements as clear as possible in order to avoid confusion
- [x] Create checklists by typing "- [ ]" at the begining of your sentences. You can mark them as done by inserting an X (i.e. - [X]) in order to track the progress in an easy way.
