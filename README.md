This is a community for like-minded individuals, passionate about ethereum and the possibilities it opens. This is a community for people like you, that like to create and experiment. However, the problem so far has been the lack of good coordination and collaboration in the ethereum builders community as a whole. 

This initiative represents a _working prototype_ of something that could become a full fledged extension and ethereum application in the near future, with enough support. We start small, with a Chrome extension, a GitHub account and Bitcoin. With these 3 ingredients we can already begin working on it and other ideas as well.

You are welcome to experiment here, so throw your craziest of ideas on the boards. Have fun!

### Step one. Supercharge GitHub.

Here's how you can transform your usual GitHub account into a powerful project management tool in two steps.

**1.** Go to https://www.zenhub.io/ or directly install the Chrome extension from [the webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd)

**2.** Connect your GitHub account with Zenhub. 
* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ZenHub as one of the authorized applications.

Please read these two articles if you want to understand more about how this works:
* [Getting started with ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/getting-started-with-zenhub/)
* [Supercharge GitHub Workflows](https://www.zenhub.io/blog/supercharge-github-workflows-introducing-zenhub-part-i/)

*Please note that you __need__ to install the zenhub extension in order to view and use GitHub as described in this guide. 

Now, a new tab appears on your GitHub page called "board". Each new issue becomes a card on the zenhub board

This is how it should look like:

### Step two. Tokenize GitHub comments.

A token of appreciation goes a long way! Mention the lucky @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send.

Here's how to get you started:

**1.** Connect your GitHub account with [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/github)

* You can check if everything went okay by checking [your Github application settings](https://github.com/settings/applications). You should see ChangeTip as one of the authorized applications.

**2.** Reward programmers for their effort by simply mentioning their @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send. For example "@changetip send 0.01 BTC to @username".

![Here's how it should look like](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/62df85ca0273b075614a36ac7c0bf067f59a5752/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d6644613031532e706e67)

**3.** Enjoy the warm, fuzzy feeling for contributing to something world-changing :)

That's it, you're set. Let's get to the next step.

### Step three. GitChat.

Each issue now becomes also a chatroom.

### Step four. Ideate, co-create and support! GitHub is your playing ground.

##### Ideate

* [DAPP idea template](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/ideas/wiki/DAPP-idea-template) 
* [DAO idea template](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/ideas/wiki/DAO-idea-template)

##### Co-create

* [Basic DAO proposal template](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals/wiki/basic-DAO-template)
* [Basic DAPP proposal template](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals/wiki/Basic-DAPP-template) 

#### Contribute and support

* Go to [the ideas board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/ideas#boards "ethereum.builders/ideas") for concepts in idea stages
* Go to [the proposal board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/proposals#boards "ethereum.builders/proposals") for concepts in proposal stages
* Go to [our projects board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/projects#boards "ethereum.builders/projects") for concepts in development stages

#### Accelerate the creation of **quality** content and documentation

Either via tips or bounties you can incentivize the creation of the content (blogpost, screencast, tutorial) or documentation for the applications and topics that excite you! You're now a co-creator of a new _Internet_, through GitHub, a browser extension and Bitcoin. How cool is that? 

### Bounties for the things you want to see done! 

Bounties are an excellent way to get things done. Make sure to follow the format bellow for easy visibility. 

Here's an [article](http://blog.bountysource.com/post/89776164469/waffle-bountysource-attracting-open-source-community ) showing how an integration between a different (but similar) product and github works for bounties. Will make our own example soon.

#### How to create bounties

**1.** Go to one of the boards, or create a new one. 

**2.** Create an issue with the **label** __bounty__  

**3.** The bounty __[amount]__ must be added at the end of the issue name

**4.** The description of the task should list the requirements as clear as possible in order to avoid confusion. Think it through before posting it. 

- [x] Create checklists by typing "- [ ]" at the begining of your sentences. You can mark them as done by inserting an X (i.e. - [X]) in order to track the progress in an easy way. 

*[Here is a markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help you format the description*

*More info on tasklists can be found [here](https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)*

#### How to pay the bounties?

Easy! At delivery, mention the @username in a comment together with @changetip and the specific amount that you want to send. For example "@changetip send 0.01 BTC to @username".
